        The blinx project complements the <a href="https://codeboot.org/">
            CodeBoot project
        </a>.<br>
        The aim of the CodeBoot Project is to create a web application
        that lets you do programming, especially Python,
        from a browser, without any client-side installation.<br>
        The blinx project is the integration of microcontrollers into the
        web application.
        Thanks to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Serial_API">
            web serial api
        </a> available on Google Chrome (as well as on Edge, Opera, chromium base browser).<br>
        The aim is to be able to control a microcontroller (the blinx) from the
        codeboot web application.<br>
        The project saw the light of day with the "school reform" at CEGEP, where programming
        become a requirement.<br>
        My supervisor wanted to offer CodeBoot to CEGEP as a learning tool.
        And Blinx, came as an extension of the possibilities, especially for the project required.
