        I'm tutoring a student at Collège Stanislas.<br>
        He had difficulties, so he had to use a computer
        for all his courses and exams.<br>
        Since I've been using a computer for my courses and exams
        and exams since I was 13.<br>
        I was asked to help him get to know different tools,
        teach him different tricks and tools to help him, both during courses and exams.<br>
