        with the mission of contributing to the preservation of the
        culinary heritage of the semi-desert region of Queretaro, Mexico.

        This project seeks to use technology to
        build new ways of interacting with communities,
        and preserve their knowledge.
        <br>
        Initially, the project will focus on the creation of a chatbot,
        on Facebook (Messenger) for the time being.
        <br>
        The chatbot will take a comment in which the user has given
        instructions and send back a recipe for traditional Mexican cuisine.
        <br>
        What's more, the chatbot needs to be able to evolve:
        adding new functionality, adding recipes from the community, etc.
        <br>
        In the future, we'd like to have an application that makes
        more fun and instructive interaction with the user,
        compared to a chatbot.

        Languages used during the internship :
        <ul class="lang">
            <li>Python, for the chatbot and chatbot server</li>
            <li>MySQL, for the recipes database</li>
